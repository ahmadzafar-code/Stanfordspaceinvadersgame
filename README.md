## Project description

We developed a modified version of the famous 'Space Invaders' game making it Stanford-Cal Big Game themed. The game works in a way that there are Cal Bears as the space invaders who are shooting C's at you. You being the 'Cardinal Tree' have to avoid them and At the same time shoot the Bears back with your '+' bullets. There are two scores in the game simultaneously just like real Football. Every time you get hit by a 'C', Berkeley scores. Every time you hit a Bear, Stanford's score increases. You have 30 seconds and you have to shoot more Bears than the C's that hit you to ultimately win the game, and break Stanford's losing streak.
